# Android Bluetooth Low Energy
Performing BLE operations on Android like scanning, connecting, reading, writing and setting up indications or notifications.
It is a **work in progress** ðŸš§.

This app is built entirely with Kotlin and Jetpack Compose, it follows the [official architecture guidance](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/guide) as closely as possible.


### Features
*   Performing a BLE scan.
*   Connecting to a BLE device.
*   Discovering services.
*   Requesting for a larger ATT MTU.
*   Performing a read or write operation.
*   Subscribing to notifications or indications.

### Highlights
* **MVVM** architecture.
* **Hilt** dependency injection.
* **Android BLE SDK** Handling BLE operations.
* **Google Accompanist** Android runtime permissions support.
